currently requires some manual work until I finish changes to some scripts but as is these can be dropped into the vrm extension common\humanbonemapping folder and pretty much automatically handle conversion of any of the listed game meshes with properly named bones to vrm format, packing mats and handling pose differences. It can even unfuck hoyoverse's horrendous hand poses for genshin models (why did they do that). this also allows for easy interop with mmd, unreal, etc.
that's just the power of the built in vrm extension, I've done some additional work to also handle converting 3dmigoto dumps, actually renaming the bones since vrm doesn't do that, and merging bones/VGs so that only the ones mapped by the extension have weights. As is some of the meshes will have broken posing
with my scripts (once completed) or some manual work its pretty easy to transfer animations between rig types although root motion is usually lost. VMDs will probably always require some work but its not a huge task

to convert poses, e.g. to get a wuwa character to have hand posing like genshin, without additional scripts you need to bake the current pose as an action, set the vrm rig type to vrm1, automap the bones, and export as vrma then import onto the new mesh and set that animation. This won't take care of scaling differences though, e.g. genshin characters have freakishly large heads roughly 25% larger than everything else. Ideally though you should make everything T pose and do your weight matching there. Then you change rigs to the one you want to export onto and undo all transformations. All this should hopefully be covered in due time
